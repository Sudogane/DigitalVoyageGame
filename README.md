## üöÄ About

**The Digital Voyage Project** is a browser-based RPG that immerses players into a nostalgic Digimon-inspired world, where they can command their own digital creatures in epic battles, explore fascinating stages, and dive into a captivating narrative. Our game has the following standout features:

- **Combat System**:  
  Engage in tactical 3-versus-3 battles inspired by classic DS Digimon games, combining strategic team-building with fluid combat mechanics. Players can evolve their creatures mid-battle and execute combo moves to outsmart opponents.
  
- **Point-and-Click Adventure**:  
  Instead of an overwhelming open world, we focus on a streamlined point-and-click adventure system, making the campaign easy to follow and navigate. Players can simply click icons to explore new stages, ensuring an accessible experience for both newcomers and long-time fans.

- **Progress at Your Own Pace**:  
  In contrast to many grind-heavy games, *Digital Voyage* allows players to improve their digital creatures and equipment without needing to invest countless hours. Whether you're a casual player or a dedicated gamer, you can advance at your own rhythm and stay competitive.

- **Open Source Initiative**:  
  We believe in the power of open-source collaboration, which is why this project is not only for playing but also for contributing! Developers from around the world can participate, suggest improvements, or even create custom content for the game.

- **Player-Driven Evolution**:  
  The game evolves with the community. Player feedback, contributions, and content creation will continuously shape future updates, ensuring that *Digital Voyage* grows alongside its players.

### Project Vision

This project has been a dream since childhood ‚Äî a labor of love. My vision was to create a Digimon-style game that is accessible, engaging, and not bound by corporate constraints. While the journey of development has been long and challenging, releasing this version marks only the start of something much bigger. *Digital Voyage* is more than just a game; it's a growing ecosystem that allows both players and developers to collaborate in building the ultimate digital world.

> **Future Roadmap**  
> - **PvP Arenas**: Face off against other players in ranked online battles.  
> - **Expanding the Storyline**: Unveil more chapters in the campaign, adding depth to the lore of the Digital Voyage universe.  
> - **Custom Creature Creation**: Allow users to create their own creatures, which can be shared and battled with others.
